# Design Patterns - Observer Pattern

A one to many dependency between objects so that when one object (the subject) changes state, all of its dependents (observers) are notified and update automatically.
In this example the subject is a forcast transmitter, and the observers are forcasters. When the temperate changes on transmiter all forcasters are notified and update their readings.
