# Design Patterns - Facade Pattern

The facade pattern exposes an interface that is used to simplify and combine a set of more complex processes. 
In this example the our app runs 'BuildOrder' on the 'IOrderBuilderService'. The implementation of this method creates an order, adds discounts and applys a promotion code.
